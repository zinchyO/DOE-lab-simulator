| **Property** | **Description** |
|---|---|
|**Mediator**| The behavior that this provider communicates with for access to the mediator's XR Body Transformer. If one is not provided, this provider will attempt to locate one during its Awake call. |
|**Transform Priority**| The queue order of this provider's transformations of the XR Origin. The lower the value, the earlier the transformations are applied. |
| **Move Speed** | The speed, in units per second, to move forward. |
| **Enable Strafe** | Controls whether to enable strafing (sideways movement). |
| **Enable Fly** | Controls whether to enable flying (unconstrained movement). This overrides **Use Gravity**. |
| **Use Gravity** | Controls whether gravity affects this provider when a `CharacterController` is used. This only applies when **Enable Fly** is disabled. |
| **Gravity Application Mode** | Controls when gravity begins to take effect. |
| &emsp;Attempting Move | Use this style when you don't want gravity to apply when the player physically walks away and off a ground surface. Gravity will only begin to move the player back down to the ground when they try to use input to move. |
| &emsp;Immediately | Applies gravity and locomotion every frame, even without move input. Use this style when you want gravity to apply when the player physically walks away and off a ground surface, even when there is no input to move. |
| **Forward Source** | The source `Transform` that defines the forward direction. |
| **Left Hand Move Input** | Reads input data from the left hand controller. Input Action must be a Value action type (Vector 2). |
| **Right Hand Move Input** | Reads input data from the right hand controller. Input Action must be a Value action type (Vector 2). |
